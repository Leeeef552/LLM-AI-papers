# Notes:
## keywords that exhibit reasoning / thought process patterns:

### Analysis: These phrases mimic task understanding and problem framing, essential for structured reasoning.
1. "The user asked for":
2. "Ok, so i need to":
3. "The user asked for..." → Identifies the core task or query.
4. "Breaking this down..." → Explicit decomposition of complex problems.
5. "The main challenge here is..." → Pinpoints critical obstacles.
6. "This hinges on..." → Highlights dependencies or pivotal concepts.


### Sequential / chain of thought:
1. "Step {x}:": indicates the model is using sequential thinking, chain of thought
2. First,|Second,|Next,|Finally,
3. "Since"
4. "Therefore...", "As a result..." → Connects premises to conclusions.
5. "This implies that..." → Logical deduction.


### Plan and solve
1. "To solve this, I will first..." → Outlines a strategy before execution.
2. "Phase 1: Analysis. Phase 2: Synthesis." → Multi-stage workflows.
3. "Verify if the plan covers all constraints." → Pre-execution validation.
4. "Adjusting the plan based on..." → Dynamic replanning.


### Decomposed Prompting
1. "Let's break this problem into smaller parts..." → Initiates problem decomposition.
2. "Considering each component separately..." → Addresses individual elements.
3. "After solving these parts, we can..." → Synthesizes partial solutions.
4. "Let’s decompose this into subproblems:" → Hierarchical breakdown.
5. "Subtask 1: ... Subtask 2: ..." → Explicit partitioning.
6. "First, identify the variables..." → Component isolation.


### Refinement / Reflection / Verification:
1. "Wait": indicating reflection / refinement
2. "I need to verify"
3. "I should check"
4. "Wait, but..." → Self-correction or doubt.
5. "Is this assumption valid?" → Critical evaluation.
6. "Let me rephrase..." → Clarification of ambiguous statements.
7. "Earlier, I said... but now..." → Temporal reflection.


### Path creation / tree width growth:
1. "Alternatively"
2. "I could"
3. "Or,"
4. "Another angle,":
5. "What if we...?" → Hypothesis generation.
6. "Branching out..." → Tree-like exploration
7. "Another point is"


### Action / Establishment:
1. "Let me start by"
2. "I should"
3. "I need to"
4. "I could"
5. "Let me start by..." → Task initialization.
6. "I need to compute..." → Goal-directed action.
7. "To address this, I’ll..." → Strategic planning.

### Asking questions:
1. question marks
2. "Why does this happen?" → Causal inquiry.
3. "Is there evidence for...?" → Empirical validation.
4. "Could this be incorrect?" → Uncertainty acknowledgment.
5. "What’s missing here?" → Gap analysis.


### Error Detection & Recovery
1. "I made a mistake earlier..." → Self-error identification.
2. "Let me backtrack..." → Course correction.
3. "This contradicts [X]..." → Consistency checking.
4. "Updating my approach..." → Adaptive iteration.


### Convergence:
1. "So, putting this together"
2. "Putting it all together"
3. "Putting this all together..." → Integration of ideas.
4. "In summary..." → Abstraction/simplification.
5. "The overarching theme is..." → High-level synthesis.
